= Introduction =

Before creating Zippy Photos A lot of research was done and many many photo album systems were tried.  Gallery 2 is the only one that could do everything desired and it was still missing one key feature.  See the desired [http://code.google.com/p/zippyphotos/wiki/Requirements requirements] for a Photo Album System.

Once It was determined that Zippy Photos was needed It was first implemented in .NET (C#).  However the first iteration was not very scalable and it was also desired to switch to a linux server and this would not have been feasable.  For that reason development started on the current php based version.
