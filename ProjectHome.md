zippy - _adjective_ - quick and energetic.

**1.0.0 Released!** _It's probably not ready yet but i've decided to give it a go.  This version includes all the features originally desired.  If you use it you will notice that it is somewhat slow with thumbnail generation.  This stems from the usage of GD and will be addressed in the next release._

A simple, lightweight & extendable php based gallery system.  ZippyPhotos is designed around the filesystem.  Rather than using a database everything is managed within the filesystem and generated at runtime.  the only files generated is a flat file containing one row for each album.  This is for the RSS feed feature.

DISCLAIMER:  This project is in its initial development stages.  the current version is 0.0.0 for this reason.  An initial version 1.0.0 is comming very soon.  Any suggestions/feedback would be greatly appreciated.
